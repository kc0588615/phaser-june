# Responsive Board Scaling and Centering Fix

## Problem Description
The game board had scaling and positioning issues:
- Board remained left-aligned at all screen sizes (stuck at 12px margin)
- Gems stopped scaling beyond ~415px width
- No centering on desktop screens (missing classic "black bars" effect)
- Board didn't utilize available screen space efficiently on larger displays

## Solution Implemented

### Responsive Breakpoint System
Added intelligent responsive behavior that adapts to screen size:

#### Mobile Mode (< 768px width)
- **Board Position**: Left-aligned with 12px margin
- **Rationale**: Maximizes limited screen space on mobile devices
- **Owl Position**: Aligned with board's left edge

#### Desktop Mode (â‰¥ 768px width)  
- **Board Position**: Horizontally centered
- **Rationale**: Classic game board appearance with black bars
- **Owl Position**: Offset from board for better visual balance

### Scaling Improvements
1. **Maximum Gem Size**: Capped at 80px to prevent oversized gems on large screens
2. **Minimum Gem Size**: Maintained at 24px for very small screens
3. **Dynamic Scaling**: Board scales appropriately within min/max constraints
4. **Usable Space Calculation**:
   - Mobile: 95% of screen width (maximizes space)
   - Desktop: 85% of screen width (allows for comfortable margins)

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files
1. **`src/game/scenes/Game.ts`**:
   - Updated `calculateBoardDimensions()` method with responsive logic
   - Added mobile/desktop detection based on 768px breakpoint
   - Implemented conditional positioning (left-aligned vs centered)
   - Added maximum gem size constraint (80px)
   - Updated owl positioning logic in both `create()` and `handleResize()`

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Responsive breakpoints
const MOBILE_BREAKPOINT = 768;
const MAX_GEM_SIZE = 80; // Maximum gem size for desktop
const MIN_GEM_SIZE = 24; // Minimum gem size for very small screens

// Determine if we're on mobile or desktop
const isMobile = width < MOBILE_BREAKPOINT;

// Position board based on screen size
if (isMobile) {
    // Mobile: Left-aligned with small margin
    this.boardOffset = {
        x: leftMargin,
        y: Math.round((height - boardHeight) / 2)
    };
} else {
    // Desktop: Centered horizontally
    this.boardOffset = {
        x: Math.round((width - boardWidth) / 2),
        y: Math.round((height - boardHeight) / 2)
    };
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Desktop Testing
1. Open the game on a desktop browser (fullscreen or windowed)
2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Board should be centered horizontally
   - Black bars should appear on left and right sides
   - Gems should scale up to maximum size (80px) 
   - Board maintains centered position during window resize

### Mobile Testing  
1. Open the game on a mobile device or resize browser window < 768px
2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Board should be left-aligned with small margin
   - Gems should scale to fit screen width
   - No wasted horizontal space
   - Smooth scaling as viewport changes

### Responsive Transition
1. Start with a wide desktop window
2. Gradually resize narrower past 768px breakpoint
3. **Expected behavior**:
   - Board transitions from centered to left-aligned at breakpoint
   - Owl sprite adjusts position accordingly
   - Gem sizing adapts smoothly

## Benefits
- **Mobile Experience**: Optimized space usage on small screens
- **Desktop Experience**: Classic centered game board with black bars
- **Scalability**: Proper constraints prevent oversized/undersized gems
- **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust breakpoints and sizing limits
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of mobile/desktop logic

## Future Considerations
- Could add intermediate breakpoints for tablets (e.g., 1024px)
- Consider user preference toggle for board positioning
- Potential for landscape/portrait specific layouts on mobile
