<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

# COG Configuration Guide

## Overview
Your app now supports configurable COG URLs through environment variables. This allows you to easily switch between local COG files and remote Azure Blob Storage COGs without changing code.

## Configuration Options

### Option 1: Public Azure Blob (Recommended)
If your blob is publicly accessible:
```
COG_URL=https://azurecog.blob.core.windows.net/cogtif/habitat_cog.tif
```

### Option 2: Private Azure Blob with SAS Token
If your blob is private, use the full SAS URL:
```
COG_URL=https://azurecog.blob.core.windows.net/cogtif/habitat_cog.tif?sp=r&st=2025-06-13T20:58:01Z&se=2025-06-14T04:58:01Z&sv=2024-11-04&sr=c&sig=K%2FsxjRpPVAxLNjjyRykKgv9wPQF%2FNqgApF%2BIhIZs9Qo%3D
```

### Option 3: Local COG File (Default)
If no environment variable is set, it defaults to:
```
COG_URL=/app/data/habitat_cog.tif
```

## How to Set the Environment Variable

### For Docker Compose (Recommended)
1. Edit `docker-compose.override.yml` (already created for you)
2. Update the `COG_URL` value under the `environment` section
3. Run: `docker-compose up --build`

### For Azure Container Apps
1. Go to your Azure Container App in the Azure Portal
2. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Environment variables**
3. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Name**: `COG_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://azurecog.blob.core.windows.net/cogtif/habitat_cog.tif`
4. Save and restart your container app

### For Docker Run Command
```powershell
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e COG_URL="https://azurecog.blob.core.windows.net/cogtif/habitat_cog.tif" your-image-name
```

## Testing the Configuration

1. **Start your application**:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Check the configuration endpoint**:
   Open http://localhost:8000/api/config in your browser
   You should see:
   ```json
   {
     "cogUrl": "https://azurecog.blob.core.windows.net/cogtif/habitat_cog.tif",
     "titilerBaseUrl": "http://localhost:8000",
     "gameApiBaseUrl": "http://localhost:8000"
   }
   ```

3. **Open the map**:
   Open `index.html` in your browser or serve it through a web server
   Check the browser console for messages like:
   ```
   Configuration loaded: {cogUrl: "https://azurecog.blob.core.windows.net/cogtif/habitat_cog.tif", ...}
   Using COG path: https://azurecog.blob.core.windows.net/cogtif/habitat_cog.tif
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### If the COG doesn't load:
1. Check that the Azure Blob URL is accessible (try opening it directly in a browser)
2. Verify the SAS token hasn't expired (valid until 2025-06-14T04:58:01Z)
3. Check the browser network tab for any CORS errors
4. Verify the COG file format is valid

### If configuration doesn't load:
1. Ensure the backend is running on port 8000
2. Check for CORS issues if serving the frontend from a different port
3. Verify the `/api/config` endpoint is accessible

## SAS Token Renewal
Your current SAS token expires on **June 14, 2025 at 04:58:01 UTC**. To renew:
1. Generate a new SAS token in Azure Storage
2. Update the `COG_URL` environment variable
3. Restart your application

# TiTiler + Game Backend API - Docker Version

This application is a dockerized version of the TiTiler-based habitat mapping and species query API.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- PostgreSQL database with habitat and species data accessible from Docker container
- COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) files for the habitat data

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Docker Image

```powershell
docker build -t titiler-game-api .
```

### 2. Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

```powershell
docker-compose up
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Run with Docker Command

```powershell
docker run -p 8000:8000 `
  -e DB_HOST=host.docker.internal `
  -e DB_PASSWORD=your_password `
  -v "C:/path/to/your/cog/files:/app/data/external" `
  titiler-game-api
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DB_HOST`: Database host (default: `host.docker.internal` for local PostgreSQL)
- `DB_PORT`: Database port (default: `5432`)
- `DB_NAME`: Database name (default: `phaser`)
- `DB_USER`: Database user (default: `postgres`)
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password (default: `apple`)
- `TITILER_API_ALLOW_FILE_ACCESS`: Allow file access (default: `true`)

### Volume Mounts

If you have COG files outside the container, mount them:

```powershell
-v "C:/OSGeo4W/geoTif:/app/data/external"
```

Then update the `cogPath` in `index.html` to use `/app/data/external/habitat_cog.tif`.

## File Structure

```
/app/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py              # Main FastAPI application
│   ├── colormaps.py         # Custom colormap handling
│   ├── dependencies.py     # TiTiler dependencies
│   └── __init__.py
├── habitat_colormap.json    # Habitat colormap definitions
├── data/                    # Local COG files
└── data/external/          # Mounted external COG files (if used)
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /cog/{tms}/tilejson.json` - TiTiler tile JSON endpoint
- `GET /cog/{tms}/{z}/{x}/{y}` - TiTiler tile endpoint
- `GET /api/location_info/` - Query habitat and species info for coordinates

## Frontend

Open `index.html` in a web browser to test the Cesium-based frontend. Make sure to update the `cogPath` variable to match your COG file location within the container.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you can't connect to your local PostgreSQL:

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running on your host machine
2. Check that PostgreSQL accepts connections from Docker (usually requires updating `pg_hba.conf`)
3. Verify the database credentials in environment variables

### COG File Not Found

1. Check the volume mount path
2. Verify the file exists in the mounted directory
3. Update the `cogPath` in `index.html` to match the container path

### CORS Issues

The application includes permissive CORS settings for development. For production, update the `origins` list in `app/main.py`.

## Development

To modify the application:

1. Make changes to the source code
2. Rebuild the Docker image: `docker build -t titiler-game-api .`
3. Restart the container

## Production Notes

- Remove the wildcard (`*`) from CORS origins
- Use proper secrets management for database passwords
- Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx) for HTTPS
- Mount COG files from a persistent volume or object storage
